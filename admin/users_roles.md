# Managing team members and roles
{: #userroles}
Last updated: 12 July 2016
{: .last-updated}

From the **Team Directory** page for your account, you can manage existing team members and their roles in your organization and spaces, as well as invite new team members. To access the team directory for your account, go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Team Directory**. 
{:shortdesc}

Account owners perform all operations on organizations and spaces including managing team members and their assigned roles. Organization managers  have access to invite team members and manage roles. Space managers can use the **Manage Organizations** page to add existing account members to the space and adjust their roles. Check out the following information to learn more about roles.

## Roles
{: #userrolesinfo}

At the account level, there are two roles that enable access to different account management features:

*Table 1. Account roles and permissions*

| Account role | Permissions |    
|----------------|---------|
|Owner | An owner for the account has access to their profile, team directory, billing information, spending notifications, and usage dashboard. From the team directory page, the owner can invite new team members and adjust roles. The owner can also add promotional credits, set or change the billing limit, set service access, and manage organizations and spaces. |
|Member | A member has access to their profile, team directory, and account credits and billing limits in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} header. However, on the team directory page, a member can only view the team members within the account. |

 All new team members are added as a member of the account. You can assign organization and space roles to invitees to enable specific views and permissions in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. New team members added to an organization are assigned the auditor organization role by default. For a specific space, you can choose to assign the developer or auditor role to invitees. Once your invitees accept the invitation and join {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can edit their roles on the **Team Directory** page.

The following roles can be assigned at the organization level:

*Table 2. Organization roles and permissions*

| Organization role | Permissions |    
|-------------------|-------------|
|Manager | Organization managers can create, view, edit, or delete spaces within the organization, view the organization's usage and quota, invite team members to the organization, manage who has access to the organization and their roles in the organization, and manage custom domains for the organization. |
|Billing manager | Billing managers can view runtime and service usage information for the organization on the Usage Dashboard page.  |
|Auditor | Organization auditors can view application and service content in the organization. Auditors can also view the team members in the organization and their assigned roles, and the quota for the organization. This role is assigned to all invitees by default.|

The following roles can be assigned at the space level:

*Table 3. Space roles and permissions*

| Space role | Permissions |    
|------------|-------------|
|Manager | Space managers can add existing team members and manage roles within the space. The space manager can also view the number of instances, service bindings, and resource use for each application in the space. |
|Developer | Space developers can create, delete, and manage applications and services within the space. Some of the managing tasks include deploying apps, starting or stopping apps, renaming an app, deleting an app, renaming a space, binding or unbinding a service to an application, view the number or instances, service bindings, and resource use for each application in the space. In addition, the space developer can associate an internal or external URL with an application in the space.   |
|Auditor | Space auditors have read-only access to all information about the space, such as information about the number of instances, service bindings, and resource use for each application in the space. |

**Note**: Team members that are assigned the manager or developer space role can access the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable. However, a team member that is assigned the auditor role can't access VCAP_SERVICES.

## Adjusting visibility of the team directory
{: #teamdirectoryvisibility}

Depending on how you have your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} accounts and organizations set up, you might want to change the visibility of the team directory page. By default, all team members within your account can see the full list of account team members, including all members of all organizations within the account. You might have privacy concerns or security reasons that prompt you to adjust the visibility of the team directory page. You have two options for setting the visibility of the team directory page: all team members or just you as the account owner.

To change the visibility of the team directory page complete the following steps:

1. Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Team Directory**. 
2. For the **Visibility to** option, click the current selection to view the options.
3. Then, select **All** or **Just me** based on the current needs for your account.

## Inviting team members
{: #inviteteammembers}

Account owners and organization managers can invite team members to orgs from the Invite Team Members page. When you add new team members, they are assigned the auditor roles automatically. You can change the roles later on the Team Directory page. To invite a team member, complete these steps:

<ol>
<li>Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Invite Team Member**.</li>

<li>Click **Next**.</li>

<li>Enter the email address for an individual team member, or email addresses for multiple team members:
<ul>
<li>To add a single team member, enter the email address, and click **Send**.</li>
<li>To add more than one team member, click **Invite them all at once**. Enter the email addresses using a comma-separated list, spaces, or line breaks. Then, click **Next** to verify the email addresses to send the invites to, and click **Send**.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Click **View Pending** to check if invites are pending or accepted. You can choose to resend the invitation email or cancel the invitation for a pending invite at any time.
