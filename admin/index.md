## Notifications and event subscriptions
{: #oc_eventsubscription}

You can always know the status of your environment by checking the Status page. As they occur, incidents are reported on the Status page. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also sends notifications to the Notifications area on the Administration page for events such as scheduled or pending maintenance updates.

### Notifications

You can view notifications for your local or dedicated environment to monitor the status of your environment. Review the following table for information about the different types of notifications and where each notification type is posted.

*Table 2. Event types and notifications methods*

## Maintenance updates
{: #oc_schedulemaintenance}

You can view scheduled and pending maintenance updates by going to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending** to access the **System Updates** page. 

**Note**: See the following section for [Setting preapproved maintenance windows](index.html#preapprovedmaintenance) to get you started. These windows must be set in order for IBM to schedule maintenance for your environment.

<dl>
<dt>Non-disruptive updates</dt>
<dd>A non-disruptive update does not affect your environment, your running applications, or your users' access to your applications. This update type does not require case-by-case approval and will be applied during the preapproved, available maintenance windows that you set from the System Updates page.</dd>
<dt>Disruptive updates</dt>
<dd>A disruptive update might affect your environment, running applications, or your users' access to your applications. You must schedule and approve each of these maintenance updates within the allotted 21-day maintenance window. You can select the suggested deployment date and time, the option for any of your preapproved windows, or you can open the calendar to select three specific dates and times for IBM to choose from when scheduling the update.</dd>
</dl>


### Setting preapproved maintenance windows
{: #preapprovedmaintenance}

Before you start scheduling and approving updates, you must set your preapproved maintenance windows. Non-disruptive updates are scheduled during the preapproved window times. 

You are required to set a minimum of 24 available hours for a week for a minimum of three days during each week. For example, you can set three 8-hour windows across three separate days, or you can set 6-hour windows across four separate days. To ensure that the windows provide enough time for an update to be applied, each window must be a minimum of four hours in duration.

**Note**: Only users with the Admin permission (`ops.admin`) can schedule and approve maintenance updates.

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending &gt; Manage Availability**.
2. Expand the **Manage Available Update Windows** section.
3. Click **Add new** ![Add new](images/add-new.png).
4. Set your first availability window by selecting the frequency, duration, and start time for the window.
5. Click **Submit**.
6. Repeat this process until you have met the minimum requirements for the weekly windows.

### Setting unavailable maintenance windows

After you set your preapproved available maintenance windows, you can choose to set specific dates and times that your environment is not available for updates. For example, you might choose a high traffic weekend or holiday when you do not want any maintenance applied to ensure that your applications are available for your users.

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending &gt; Manage Availability**.
2. Expand the **Manage Unavailable Update Windows** section.
3. Click **Add new** ![Add new](images/add-new.png).
4. Set your unavailable window by selecting the frequency, duration, and start time for the window.
5. Click **Submit**.

### Scheduling and approving updates
{: #scheduleandapprove}

After you set your preapproved maintenance windows, non-disruptive updates will be automatically scheduled during those times. Your explicit approval for these types of updates is not required. However, you can view the details for each maintenance update including what is being updated, how long the update will take, and when the update is scheduled. 

To view the details for a non-disruptive update, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending**.
2. Identify any rows that have **Customer Scheduling Required** set to **No**.
3. Select the row for that update to view the details.

A disruptive update might affect your environment, running applications, or your users' access to your applications. You must schedule and approve each of these maintenance updates within the alloted 21-day maintenance window. You can select the suggested deployment date and time, the option for any of your preapproved windows, or you can open the calendar to select three specific dates and times for IBM to choose from when scheduling the update.

For disruptive updates that do require your approval, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **ADMINISTRATION &gt; SYSTEM INFORMATION &gt; *Number* pending**.
2. Identify any rows that have **Customer Scheduling Required** set to **Yes**.
3. Select the row for that update to review the details for the update including the update description, suggested date and time for the update, the affected components, and duration for the update.
4. Select **Schedule and Approve**.
5. Choose from the following options: **Suggested date**, **Specific dates**, or **Any preapproved window**. If you select **Specific dates**, you can open the calendar to select three options for IBM to choose from.
6. Select **Submit** when you are finished. 

Based on your selection, the update is scheduled for deployment during the suggested date that you accepted, during one of your preapproved windows, or one of the specific dates and times that you selected. When the update is scheduled for deployment by IBM, you see the scheduled date reflected in the details for the update on the **System Updates** page.

### Registering a service broker
{: #servicebrokerui}

If you have a service that you want to display in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, you must implement and register a service broker. After registering your broker, you can choose which orgs can access the service in your local or dedicated instance.

The methods for working with you service broker vary depending on how many services it manages, or whether it has already been registered with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

- If your service broker manages one service, you can use the user interface to register it after you have implemented the [Service Broker API](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html){: new_window}. See [Registering a service broker that manages one service](index.html#registerbrokerui).
- If your service broker manages multiple services, at this time, you can't register it after you have implemented the Service Broker API. Instead, use the cf CLI with the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin CLI](../cli/plugins/bluemix_admin/index.html) plug-in (`ba` subcommand), or use the [Custom service API](index.html#servicebrokerapi).
- If your service broker is already registered, and you want to update or delete it, use the cf CLI with the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin CLI](../cli/plugins/bluemix_admin/index.html) plug-in (`ba` subcommand), or use the [Custom service API](index.html#servicebrokerapi).

#### Registering a service broker that manages one service
{: #registerbrokerui}

Complete the following steps to register your service broker:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html" target="_blank">Implement the Cloud Foundry Service Broker API</a> to enable communication between your service and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The Service Broker API is a set of REST endpoints that are consumed by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.<br />
<br />
<p>When you are implementing the service broker, in the JSON response of <code>GET /v2/catalog</code>, you must provide the definitions for your service and service plans, including the service information that you want to display. For example, review the following sample JSON of the Catalog (GET) response</p>
<p><pre>
"services":[
   {
      "bindable":true,
      "description":"Cool Service is a data warehousing and analytics solution.",
      "id":"cool-service-id",
      "name":"coolservice",
      "tags":[
         "customer_dedicated"
      ],
      "metadata":{

## Administering organizations
{: #oc_organizations}

You can manage your organizations by creating and deleting organizations, adding or removing managers for organizations, and monitoring quota usage to make the best decisions for your business.

Click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATION**.

You can expand and view various sections. You can also review and manage the quota plans for
your organizations.

### Creating orgs

To create a new organization and add managers, complete the following steps:

1. Click <strong>CREATE ORGANIZATION</strong>.
2. Enter a name for the organization
3. Enter the name or email of the person that you want to add as a manager. You can add more than one manager by entering and
selecting multiple names.
4. Click <strong>CREATE ORGANIZATION</strong> to save your changes and
create the org.

### Creating spaces

You can create spaces in your organization; for example, a *dev* space as a development environment, a *test* space as a testing environment, and a *production* space as a production environment. Then, you can associate your apps with spaces. Complete the following steps to create a space:

1. Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Manage Organizations** page.
2. Select the org that you want to add a space to.
3. Click **Create a Space**.
4. Enter a space name.
5. Click **Create**.

### Quota monitoring

In the Quota Monitoring section, you can expand the section and view the following information:

- Environment memory usage. This section details the memory usage for the full system environment.
	The chart provides information that includes used system memory, total system memory, quota that is
	used, and the total quota allocated. The following list of terms defines the types of memory usage
	that are displayed in the chart.

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Used system memory</strong></dt>
	<dd>The physical memory that is used by your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Total system memory</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total physical memory that is available to your environment.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Quota deployed</strong></dt>
	<dd>The sum of memory that is allocated for all deployed apps, across all organizations. The sum of
	the quota deployed can exceed the physical total system memory for your environment. For example, if
	you have a total system memory of 16 GB, and you allocate 4 GB of memory each for a total of five
	different organizations, the total quota exceeds the total system memory that has been allocated to
	you for all organizations. However, in many cases, the organizations might not use the total quota
	that is allocated individually to each organization. In addition, all organizations might not use
	their total quota allocation of memory all at the same time. </dd>
	<dt><strong>Total quota</strong></dt>
	<dd>The total memory that is allocated across all organizations.</dd>
	</dl>

- Organization memory usage. This section details the memory usage at an organization level. You
	can view the total quota allowance and the quota that is deployed for each organization. The chart
	provides information that is listed by highest memory usage per organization, and the organization
	that uses the largest amount of memory, by default, is listed first. You can sort by
	** Highest Memory Usage** and **Excess Memory Allocation**.

	<dl>
	<dt><strong>Highest Memory Usage</strong></dt>
	<dd>Use this option to identify the org using the greatest amount of memory. Sort by highest memory
	usage to identify the organizations that are using the most amount of memory. The list is sorted by
	quota deployed. </dd>
	<dt><strong>Excess Memory Allocation</strong></dt>
	<dd>Use this option to identify organizations that have a quota plan that is larger than needed.
	Sort by excess memory usage to identify organizations that are using the lowest amount of memory for
	the quota that has been allocated for the org. </dd>
	</dl>

### Adjusting quota plans

To change the quota plan for an organization, complete the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Click the bar in the chart for the
organization that you want to edit in the Organization memory usage section, or select the name of
the org from the Organization List section.</li>
<li>On the Manage Organization page, you can change the quota plan, change the name of the org, and add or
remove managers.<br />
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you select a quota plan that is not sufficient for the current usage for the
organization, you receive a message.</p>
</li>
<li>To save any changes that you made on the Manage Organization page, click <strong>SAVE</strong>.</li>
</ol>

### Managing your orgs from the organization list

In the Organization List section, you can view all organizations in the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment, and you can take actions for individual orgs by clicking on the org name.

- To delete the organization, click the **Delete** icon ![Delete](images/icon_trash.svg) in the Actions column.
- To view the quota plan and usage for an organization, click the name for the organization in the
	list. On the **Manage Organizations** page for the org that you selected, you can view the following usage information:

  - Number of services that are currently in use.
  - Number of routes that are currently in use.
  - Memory quota graph that shows how much of the quota is used and how much is not currently being used.
  - Application allocation graph that shows which applications are included in the used memory quota.
  - Metered application usage graph that shows a a three-month report of used GB-hours per deployed app. You can select the **List View** to see data for all apps, including the memory allocation per app and the metered GB-hour usage for the past three months.

- To edit the name of the org and add or remove managers, click the name for the organization in
	the list and follow the prompts on the screen.

## Managing users and permissions
{: #oc_useradmin}

You can add users singly or in groups, and view user permissions. Commonly, users are added to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance from your company's user registry through Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). If you are assigned **Admin** permission, you can also set and manage permissions for other users. Click **ADMINISTRATION &gt; USER ADMINISTRATION**.

The User Administration page displays all users for the local or dedicated instance. Permissions for each user are displayed using icons in the table. Permissions can be the following: None, **Admin**, **Login**, **Catalog**, **Reports**, and **Users**. 
The **Admin** and **Login**` permissions can be set to **On** or **Off**, while the remaining permissions are enabled or disabled with specific access types, including **Read** or **Write** access for that permission, as represented by icons. See [Permissions](#permissions) for descriptions of each type and explanation of the icons.

### Working with users

Depending on your **Read** or **Write** access for the users' permissions, you can search for existing users, remove users, and add users individually or by a group. Note that if you have the **Admin** permission, you have full access to complete any tasks for user management in the environment. The following tasks can be completed to manage users. Review the following list to see if your level of access enables you to complete specific user management tasks:

* Locate users. You can locate users in the table by using the **Search**
field with **Read** or **Write** access for the users permission.

* Add a single user. If you have **Admin** permission or
**Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

  1. To add a single user from your LDAP directory, click **Add User**.
  2. In the **Search** field, type the email address for the user, and then select the user from the populated list.
  3. Next, from the **Org** field, choose the org to which you want to add the user by entering the org name and selecting it from the populated list.
  4. To add the user to the selected org, click **Add User**.

  **Note**: When the add operation is successful, the user is added to the table for you to view and search. When users are added, they have no assigned permissions.

* Add a group of users from your LDAP directory. If you have **Admin** permission or
**Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

  1. Click **Add User Group**.
  2. In the **Search** field, type a group name to search, and select the group name from the populated list.
  3. Next, from the **Org** field, choose the org to which you want to add the user group by entering the org name and selecting it from the populated list.
  4. To add the user group to the selected org, click **Add Users**.
  
  **Note**: Groups of more than 50 users are added through a background batch job. When the add operation is successful, the user or group is added to the table for you to view and search. When users are added, they have no assigned permissions.

* Add a group of users by importing a spreadsheet that includes user IDs, user email addresses, and the organization to which you plan to add the user. If you have **Admin** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access, you can add users.

**Note**: Enter user IDs that match the values used in your user registry. 

   1. Click **Import users**.
   2. Click **Download Template (.CSV)** to download a spreadsheet with the required columns that you can fill in, or you can create your own by using a spreadsheet that includes the required column headers: **User ID**, **Email**, and **Organization**.  Two optional columns are also included in the template: **First Name** and **Last Name**.
   3. Fill in the user values for the required columns. If you are not using an LDAP directory, use the required and optional column headers for the users that you are importing.
   4. Save your file, and click **Upload file**.

  **Note**: The columns within your spreadsheet can be in any order as long as you have all of the required columns. If the import was successful, you receive a confirmation message that states that all users were added. If the import was successful for some users, but not others, review the error message to take action on the users that could not be added.

* Remove users. If you have **Admin** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access, you can remove users from the environment permanently.

    1. Locate the user and click the ![Delete](images/icon_trash.svg) icon.
    2. Click **Remove**.

* Editing permissions and organizations to which users belong requires you to have **Admin** permission. To edit permissions for users, locate the user and click the user name. From the **Edit User** page, you can enable or disable permissions:

    * Select **On** from the list to enable the **Admin** or **Login** permission.
    * Select **Read** from the list to allow the user to have **Read** (read-only) access for that permission, or select **Write** to allow **Write** (edit, or add and remove) access for that permission.
    * Select **Off** to disable any of the permissions.
    
    **Note**: Setting the **Admin** permission to **On** sets all other permissions with **Write** access.

* To add or remove a user from a specific org, you must have **Admin** permission or **Users** permission with **Write** access.

    1. To add a user to an org, select the user name from the table to access the **Edit User** page. Then, use the search field to locate an org, select the org from the list, and click **Save**.
    2. To remove a user from an org, select the user name from the table to access the **Edit User** page. Then, click ![Remove](images/icon_remove.svg) for the org from which you want to remove the user, and click **Save**.

### Permissions
{: #permissions}

Users can be assigned the following permissions with specific access levels that enable the user to complete specific tasks:

*Table 7. Permissions*

| **User permission** | **Description** |       
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Admin | Users with **Admin** permission set to **On** are allowed to edit permissions for other users. If you have the permission on, it automatically enables full access to all other permissions. In addition to the tasks outlined for each permission in this table, the admin can also set up event subscriptions to get alerted directly about maintenance or incidents, schedule maintenance, run verification checks on console components, and create orgs and spaces for the environment. |
| Login | Users with **Login** permission set to **On** are allowed to see the Administration page option in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface. Users with the permission enabled can access the [System Information](#oc_system) and [Resource Usage](#oc_resource) tiles. Without this permission, users cannot see or access the Administration menu option. |
| Catalog | Users with **Catalog** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** or **Write** (modify) which services are available in the local or dedicated instance. Read access allows the user to access the Catalog Management tile to view available services. Write access allows the user to access the [Catalog Management](#oc_catalog) tile to view services, edit the visibility of services, register custom services, and control the buildpack priority list. |  
| Reports | Users with **Reports** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** or **Write** (modify) security reports. View access allows the user to access the Reports and Logs tile to download reports. Write access allows the user to view the [Reports and Logs](#oc_report) tile as well as use the CLI to upload new reports and create new categories for users to access. |
| Users | Users with **Users** permission can be assigned the access to **Read** (view) the list of users or **Write** (add or remove) users. This permission doesn't allow you to set permissions for other users. Write access allows the user to add new users to the environment, delete users from the environment, and add existing users to organizations that already exist within the environment. In addition, **Write** access allows the user to add new organizations, delete organizations, and edit the users within the organizations. |


Permissions can be enabled for the user with either **Read** or
**Write** access for that permission, as represented by the following icons:

* The ![Enabled, represented by a check mark](images/icon_enabled.svg) icon associated with a permission means that it is enabled.
* The ![Read, represented by an eye](images/icon_read.svg) icon means that the user has **Read** (read-only) access for that permission.
* The ![Write, represented by a pencil](images/icon_write.svg) icon means that the user has **Write** (edit, add, or remove) access for that permission.

## Managing users with the Admin REST API
{: #usingadminapi}

You can use the `Admin` REST API to add and remove users for your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance.
The `Admin` REST API endpoints and JSON responses are provided on an experimental
basis to enable basic operations from a command line. The endpoints and URLs in the examples in this
information might change or might be discontinued at short notice.

The following tools are prerequisites for using the examples that follow. You can choose to
use other tools as well.
* cURL, to enter REST API requests as commands. cURL is a free utility that you can use to send
HTTP requests to a server and receive the server responses through a command-line interface. You can
download cURL from the [cURL Download site](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html){: new_window}.
* Python, to use the Python pretty-print JSON tool. This optional tool takes the JSON text as
input and provides easy-to-read output. You can download Python from the [Python Downloads site](https://www.python.org/downloads){: new_window}.

### Logging in to the Admin Console

Before you can run any `Admin` API requests, you must log in to the
Admin Console. If you have `admin` permission or `users`
permission with `write` access, you can add or remove users. You must have
`admin` permission to edit other users' permissions.

To log in to the Admin Console, you can use basic access authentication on the
`https://<your_host>.ibm.com/login` endpoint. The server returns a cookie with your
session. You use that cookie for all operations with the Admin Console.

**Note:** The session becomes invalid if not used for a few hours.

To log in to the Admin Console, run the following command:

`curl --user <user_id>:<password> -c ./cookies.txt --header "Accept: application/json" https://<your_host>.ibm.com/login | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">

<dt class="pt dlterm">--user <em>user_id</em>:<em>password</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Accepts the user ID and password and sends a Basic Authorization header.</dd>


<dt class="pt dlterm">-c <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Stores the specified user ID and password as a cookie in the specified file.</dd>


<dt class="pt dlterm">--header</dt>
<dd class="pd">Sends an Accept header.</dd>

</dl>

The following example shows output from this
command:
```
{
    "message": "Logged in",
    "name": {
        "familyName": "*last_name*",
        "givenName": "*first_name*"
    }
}
```
{: screen}

### Listing organizations
{: #listingorg}

When you add a user, you must specify an organization. You can use the
`Admin` REST API to list all organizations. You must have
`users` permission with `read` access to list
organizations.To list all organizations, run the following command:

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/organizations | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">

<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>

</dl>

For each organization, the results include the following information:
* `"guid"`, GUID of the organization
* `"name"`, name of the organization

The following example shows output from this command:
```
{
     "resources": [
         {
             "guid": "05af098d-d476-4fb0-8b87-a84350e72af3",
             "name": "org-1"
         },
         {
             "guid": "5129a5a8-37c2-4ee4-a9b2-bebae3531db5",
             "name": "org-2"
         },

		 		 ....

		 ],
		 "total_results": 284
}
```
{: screen}

### Listing users
{: #listingusr}

You can determine whether a user was already added to your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment by
using the `Admin` REST API to list registered users. You must have
`users` permission with `read` access to list registered
users.To list all users, run the following command:

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>
</dl>

For each registered user, the results include the following information:
* `"first_name"` (given name) and `"last_name"` (surname)
* `"user_id"`, user ID and email address
* `"guid"`, GUID of the organization.
* `"permissions"` that are assigned to the user for the Admin Console.

The following example shows output from this command:

```
{
    "next_url": "/codi/v1/users?results_per_page=100&amp;page=2",
    "prev_url": "",
    "resources": [

### Adding a user

You can use the `Admin` REST API to add users to the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. You must
have `users` permission with `write` access to add
users.

You can add one user or a list of users. You can add users to a single
organization, or to multiple organizations.To
add a user, you must provide the following information:

* First name (given name) and last name (surname) of the user. Provide the
`"first_name"` and `"last_name"` from [Listing users](index.html#listingusr).
* Email address and user ID: Provide the `"user_id"` from [Listing users](index.html#listingusr) for both the email address and the user ID.
* `"guid"`. Provide the GUID of the organization from [Listing organizations](index.html#listingorg).

You provide the information in a JSON file.

`curl -b ./cookies.txt https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users | python -m json.tool`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-b <em>filename</em></dt>
<dd class="pd">Passes the user ID and password that was previously stored with the <samp class="ph codeph">-c</samp>
option in the file to the HTTP server as a cookie.</dd>
</dl>

<ol>
<li>Create a JSON file that contains the information in a proper JSON format.
<p>For example, create a file that is named `user.json` that has the
following content:</p>
<pre>
{
    "members": [
        {
            "emails": [
                "some_user_id@domain.com"
            ],
            "first_name": "Some_first_name",
            "last_name": "Some_last_name",
            "user_id": "some_user_id@domain.com"
        }
    ],
    "organization_roles": [
        {
            "id": "7a891f9c-e4e7-46c7-8b4e-dffaa7eb3bcd"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>Post the content of the JSON file to the user's endpoint by running the following
command:<br/><br/>
<code>
curl -v -b ./cookies.txt -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @./user.json https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users
</code>
</li>
</ol>

<dl class="parml">

<dt class="pt dlterm">-v </dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies verbose output.</dd>


<dt class="pt dlterm">-X POST</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies a POST request, overriding the default GET request.</dd>


<dt class="pt dlterm">-H "Content-Type: application/json"</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies the content-type header, which in this case is JSON.</dd>


<dt class="pt dlterm">-d *data*</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies the data, in this case the file `user.json`, to be sent in POST
request to the HTTP server.</dd>

</dl>



The following example shows output from this
command:

```

### Removing a user

You can use the `Admin` REST API to remove users from the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. You must
have `users` permission with `write` access to remove users.

To remove a user, you must provide the user ID of the user. Run the following command:

`curl -v -b ./cookies.txt -X DELETE https://<your_host>.ibm.com/codi/v1/users?user_id=<some_user_id@domain.com>`
{: codeblock}

<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">-X DELETE</dt>
<dd class="pd">Specifies a DELETE request.</dd>
</dl>

The following example shows output from this
command:

```
 * connect to ::1 port 3000 failed: Connection refused

## Managing users with the cf CLI
{: #usingadmincli}

You can manage users for your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment by
using the Cloud Foundry command line interface with the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin CLI plug-in. For
example, you can add users from an LDAP registry.

Before you begin, install the cf command line interface. The
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin CLI plug-in
requires cf version 6.11.2 or later. [Download Cloud Foundry command line interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases){: new_window}

**Restriction:** The Cloud Foundry command line interface is not supported by
Cygwin. Use the Cloud Foundry command line interface in a command line window other than the Cygwin
command line window.

### Adding the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin CLI plug-in

After the cf command line interface is installed, you can add the
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin CLI
plug-in.

**Note**: If you have previously installed the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin plug-in, you might need to uninstall the plug-in, delete the repository, and then re-install to get the latest updates.

Complete the following steps to add the repository and install the plug-in:

<ol>
<li>To add the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin plug-in repository, run the following command:<br/><br/>
<code>
cf add-plugin-repo BluemixAdmin https://console.&lt;subdomain&gt;.bluemix.net/cli
</code><br/><br/>
<dl class="parml">
<dt class="pt dlterm">&lt;subdomain&gt;</dt>
<dd class="pd">Subdomain of the URL for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>To install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin CLI plug-in, run the following command:<br/><br/>
<code>
cf install-plugin bluemix-admin-cli -r BluemixAdmin
</code>
</li>
</ol>

To see a list of commands, run the following
command:

`cf plugins`
{: codeblock}

For additional help for a command, use the `-help` option.

For more information about how to work with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Admin CLI plug-in, see [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} admin](../cli/plugins/bluemix_admin/index.html).
