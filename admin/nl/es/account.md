## Setting notifications
{: #notifications}

If you are a Pay-As-You-Go {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owner, you can set up email spending notifications. Set notifications for total account, runtime, container, and service spending, as well as spending for individual services, excluding third-party services. You receive notifications when you reach 80%, 90%, and 100% of the spending thresholds that you specify. You can edit each spending notification at any time as your needs change.

**Note**:  If you own more than one account, you can choose to set spending notifications for each individual account.

Complete the following steps to set up email notifications for spending limits:

<ol>
<li>Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Spending Notifications**.</li>
<li>Enter a numeric value to set the spending threshold for triggering a notification for each type of spending notification:<br />
<ul>
<li>Total account spending</li>
<li>Total runtime spending</li>
<li>Total services spending</li>
<li>Total container spending</li>
<li>Spending for a specific service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select **Save Settings**.</li>
</ol>

**Note**: If you have a trial account, you can upgrade to a Subscription or Pay-As-You-Go account to set spending limits. For more information about Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, see [How you are billed](../pricing/index.html#pay-accounts).

## Viewing usage
{: #acctusage}

As an account owner or a billing manager for an org, you can use the Usage Dashboard view to see the real-time charges for the runtimes, containers, services, and support that are used per month in your organizations. You can see the runtime GB-hours and service consumption in all regions, or you can select to see a particular region.

To open the Usage Dashboard view, click the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Account** &gt; *your_account_name* &gt; **Usage Dashboard**. Billing managers can see the details for only the organizations in which they are billing managers.

The account owner is charged for the total usage that is incurred across all organizations at the end of each billing cycle. As an account owner, you can filter the usage summary by region and organization. You can also click a particular month to see the usage for that month. Select **All Organizations** from the **Organizations** list to see the usage for all organizations in the account.
