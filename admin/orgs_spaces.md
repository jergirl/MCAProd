# Managing organizations and spaces
{: #orgsspacesusers}
Last updated: 16 May 2016
{: .last-updated}

As an account owner, you can manage your organizations by going to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Manage Organizations** page. Organization managers can also use the Manage Organizations page to manage any organizations where they are set as the manager.
{:shortdesc}

Management tasks include the following:

* Creating an organization or space
* Renaming an organization
* Deleting an existing organization or space
* Listing the team members added to your account or organization
* Managing or viewing the quota
* Managing custom domains

## Organizations
{: #orginfo}

Organizations can span multiple regions, and they are defined by the following items:

<dl>
<dt>Team members</dt>
<dd>The role with basic permission in organizations and spaces. You must be assigned to an organization before you can be granted other permissions to the spaces within the organization. For detailed information, see [Users and roles](users_roles.html#userrolesinfo).</dd>
<dt>Domains</dt>
<dd>Provide the route on the internet that is allocated to the organization. A route has a sub-domain and a domain. A sub-domain is typically the application name. A domain might be a system domain, or a custom domain that you registered for your application. See [Managing custom domains](orgs_spaces.html#managedomains).<br/>
<p>**Note**: If you add a custom domain, you must configure your DNS server to resolve your custom domain to point to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} system domain. In this way, when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} receives a request for your custom domain, it can properly route it to your application.</p></dd>
<dt>Quota</dt>
<dd>Represents the resource limits for the organization, including the number of services and the amount of memory that can be allocated for use by the organization. Quotas are assigned when organizations are created. Any application or service in a space of the organization contributes to the usage of the quota. With the Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription plans, you can adjust your quota for Cloud Foundry applications and containers as the needs of your organization change. See [Managing quota](orgs_spaces.html#managequota).</dd>
</dl>

In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can use organizations to enable collaboration among team members and to facilitate the logical grouping of project resources in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>You can group a set of spaces, applications, services, domains, routes, and team members together in organizations.</li>
<li>You can manage the access to the spaces and organizations on a per-user basis.</li>
</ul>

When you create an organization, the organization name must be unique in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. If the organization name is already in use by another {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public, Dedicated, or Local user, then you must specify a new name. After you create the organization, you will be automatically assigned the *Organization Manager* permission, which enables you to edit the organization name, add team members, and create or delete spaces in the organization.

You must contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support](http://ibm.biz/bluemixsupport){: new_window} to delete an organization. When you request for the support team to delete an organization, all the spaces, applications, and services within the organization are deleted.

The following [user roles](users_roles.html#userrolesinfo) can be assigned to team members in an organization:

<ul>
<li>Organization manager</li>
<li>Organization billing manager</li>
<li>Organization auditor</li>
</ul>

<!-- Add info on Manage infrastructure option under a space -->

## Spaces
{: #spaceinfo}

Within an organization, you can use spaces to group a set of applications, services, and team members. Spaces are tied to a specific region in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

After you add team members to an organization, you can grant them permissions to the spaces. Similar to organizations, spaces also have a set of [user roles](users_roles.html#userrolesinfo) with specific permissions that are assigned to team members:

<ul>
<li>Space manager</li>
<li>Space developer</li>
<li>Space auditor</li>
</ul>

**Note**: A team member must be assigned at least one of the permissions in the space.

## Managing quota
{: #managequota}

As an account owner or organization manager, you can view the allocated and used quota for your organization. The quota represents the resource limits for the org which is assigned when the org is created. Any application or service in a space of the organization contributes to the usage of the quota.

To view the quota for your org, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Manage Organizations** page.
2. Identify the organization that you want to view the quota for, and click **View Details**.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Select the **Quota** tab.

To update the quota for your organization, you must open a support ticket. For more information about openeing a support ticket, see [Getting customer support](../support/index.html#contacting-support).For more information about quota for containers, see [Quota](../containers/container_creating_ov.html#container_quota) in the Containers documentation.

## Managing domains
{: #managedomains}

As an account owner or organization manager, you can view the system domain and add custom domains for applications that are built within an organization and its spaces. As a space manager, the **Domains** tab for a space is a read-only list of the domains that are assigned to the space. 

1. Go to the **Account and Support** icon ![Account and Support icon](../admin/images/account_support.svg) &gt; **Manage Organizations** page.
2. Identify the org that you want to view or edits domains for.
3. Select **View Details** for that org.
4. Click **Edit**.
5. Click **Domains**.

If you add a custom domain, you must configure your DNS server to resolve your custom domain to point to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} system domain. In this way, when {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} receives a request for your custom domain, it can properly route it to your application. The system domain is always available to a space, and custom domains might also be allocated to a space. Applications created in a space might use any of domains listed for that space. For more information about creating and using custom domains, see [Using a custom domain](../manageapps/updapps.html#domain).
