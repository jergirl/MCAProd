# Python
{: #python_runtime}
*Last updated: 06 July 2016*
{: .last-updated}

The Python runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is powered by the python_buildpack.
The python_buildpack provides a complete runtime environment for both Python 2 and Python 3 apps.
{: shortdesc}

The python_buildpack will be used if your app's root directory contains a requirements.txt file or a setup.py file.

## Starter application
{: #starter_application}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides a Python starter application.  The Python starter application is a simple Python app that provides a template that you can use for your app. You can experiment with the starter app, and make and push changes to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}
environment.  See [Using the starter applications](../../cfapps/starter_app_usage.html) for help with using the starter application.

## Runtime versions
{: #runtime_versions}

You can specify the version of Python to be used by your app by setting python-versionnumber in the runtime.txt file in the root of your application. For example:

```
python-3.5.0
```
{: codeblock}

When a version is not specified, version 2.7.11 is chosen by default.

### Available versions:
{: #available_versions}

The following Python versions are available in the
[Python buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/python-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.5.5)
