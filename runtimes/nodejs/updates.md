# Latest Updates to the sdk-for-nodejs buildpack
{: #latest_updates}

*Last Updated: 20 June 2016*
{: .last-updated}

A list of the latest updates in the sdk-for-nodejs buildpack.
## June 22, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.5-20160609-1608

This release of the buildpack adds IBM SDK for Node.js runtime versions 4.4.5 and 6.2.0. The default becomes 4.4.5.

The release removes support for older runtime versions as announced in [Bluemix Node.js Buildpack v3.3 – FIPS mode and more](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/05/05/node-buildpack-update-fips-mode/). The buildpack now supports 0.10.44, 0.10.45, 0.12.13, 0.12.14, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, 6.1.0, and 6.2.0.

This release includes bug fixes from the [Cloud Foundry’s Node.js buildpack 1.5.14](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/tree/v1.5.14).

## May 20, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.4-20160518-1653

This release of the buildpack adds IBM SDK for Node.js runtime versions 0.10.45, 0.12.14, 4.4.4, 6.0.0, and 6.1.0. The default is now 4.4.4.

Included are fixes for the following security vulnerabilities:
* [CVE-2015-8855](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21982852)
* [CVE-2016-2108 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2109 CVE-2016-2176](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt)

Note that there is a known issue with npm v3 and the App Management inspector utility. npm 3.8.6 is the default with the 6.0.0 and 6.1.0 runtimes. If you want to use either of the 6.x runtimes and the inspector utility, you should specify a 2.x npm version in your package.json as a temporary workaround.

## April 29, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.3-20160428-1409

This release of the buildpack adds IBM SDK for Node.js runtime versions 0.10.44, 0.12.13, 4.4.0, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3. The default is now 4.4.3.
i
For 4.3.1 and up, it is now possible to use a FIPS-enabled version of the runtime by setting the `FIPS_MODE=true` environment variable for your app.

The updated buildpack and the new runtime versions also contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:
* [CVE-2016-2515](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21977578)
* [CVE-2016-2537](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21977578)
* [CVE-2016-3956](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21980827)

The updated buildpack also contains fixes for several bugs:
* Now IBM SDK for Node.js builds will always be used if one is available matching the requested range. Previously, this case was only true for 4.x runtime versions.
* Now the App Management inspector utility will work with 4.x runtime versions.
* Fixed a regression in the strongpm App Management utility.

## March 18, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.2-20160315-1257

This release of the buildpack moves the default IBM SDK for Node.js runtime from version 4.3.0 to 4.3.2. It also includes IBM SDK for Node.js versions 0.10.43, 0.12.12, and 4.3.1. Use these recent Node.js versions to pick up fixes for several security vulnerabilities.

## March 4, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.1-20160222-1123

This release of the buildpack moves the default IBM SDK for Node.js runtime from version 4.2.4 to 4.3.0. It also includes IBM SDK for Node.js versions 0.10.42, 0.12.10, and 4.2.6. Use these recent Node.js versions to pick up fixes for several security vulnerabilities.

## February 4, 2016: Updated Node.js buildpack v3.0-20160125-1224

This release is fully synchronized with the [Cloud Foundry community Node.js](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack) buildpack. In addition to community changes, modifications were made to certain defaults, along with optimizations to reduce staging time and updates to the App Management feature.

* Buildpack updates:

  * Node.js v4.2.4 (IBM SDK for Node.js Version 4) is now the default runtime on Bluemix, replacing v0.12.9. This change might cause your application to behave differently if a particular version is not specified for your application. To learn how to specify a version of Node.js for your Bluemix application, see [Node.js runtime](index.html) documentation.

  * NODE_ENV is now set to *production* by default. This change will cause some node dependencies to behave differently. For example, the Express framework will no longer return stacktraces in the web browser for faulty endpoints, but instead displays *Internal Server Error*. When NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION is set to *true*, NPM will set NODE_ENV to *production* for subshell scripts in the npm install phase only. This function allows users to set NODE_ENV to another value like *development* for application runtime. For clarity, npm scripts will see the message **NODE_ENV=production**.

  * A Bug-fix to the Monitoring and Analytics service is included.

* Caching updates:

  * If cache is disabled (NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false) the buildpack will not attempt to cache any modules/components. Previously this setting made it so that the cache is not popped, but it would still cache the installed modules for future deploys. Now, it will not pop the cache or attempt to store any cache.

  * Bower_components are cached by default in addition to node_modules.

* Other updates:

  * Added Helpful warnings for missing dependencies like gulp, bower, and angular.

  * The detect script is updated with buildpack version information.

  * The clustering recommendation (WEB_CONCURRENCY) initially introduced by community is removed as memory determination was inaccurate on Bluemix.


## December 16, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.8-20151209-1403 and v3.0beta-20151211-2041

This release of the Node.js buildpack comes with two versions, v2.8 and v3.0beta. Both these versions include the following changes:

A Bug-fix to Monitoring and Analytics service
The inclusion of a cached runtime for IBM SDK for Node.js v4.2.3.0, v4.2.2.0, v1.2.0.8 and v1.2.0.7, which are based on community versions Node.js v4.2.3, v4.2.2, v0.12.9 and v0.12.8.
In addition, in v3.0beta the default Node.js runtime is changed to v4.2.3.

IBM Node.js buildpack v3.0beta is now released as a non-default buildpack on Bluemix with Node.js v4.2.3 as the default runtime. To ensure that your apps and services will continue to work on Bluemix, push your application with the beta version of the buildpack. After 30 days or longer, v3 will be made the default buildpack.

To push your application with v3.0beta:
* Use "-b" option in your 'cf push' command:

```
        cf push -b sdk-for-nodejs-v3beta
```
{: codeblock}

* Or use the "buildpack" option in your manifest.yml file:

```
        buildpack: sdk-for-nodejs-v3beta
```
{: codeblock}

This change to the default runtime will not affect your application if you configured a specific version of Node.js in your application's package.json. **Note:** You can always specify the version of Node.js to run your application by using the engines.node entry in your package.json as explained in [Available versions](index.html#available_versions).

## November 23, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.7-20151118-1003

With 2.7, version 4.2.1.0 of the IBM SDK for Node.js (based on Node v4.2.1 LTS) is included. It is not the default yet, but can be specified for use. **Note:** This version replaces the open source build that was previously available. We also made some small bug fixes to our service extension framework.

## October 19, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.6.1-20151015-1326

Node.js v2.6.1 introduces a bug fix to the [StrongPM app management handler](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/10/15/strongloop-devops-on-bluemix/), and a more consistent NPM version.

## October 15, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.6-20151006-1309

This release of the Node.js buildpack features the integration of [StrongLoop Process Manager](https://strong-pm.io) to the App Management feature. For more information, see the blog post [StrongLoop DevOps for Node.js Applications on Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/10/15/strongloop-devops-on-bluemix/).

## June 15, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v2.0-20150608-1503

In this release, we synced our Node.js buildpack with the latest [CF community Node.js buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack), which comes with a number of new features from the community.

## May 5, 2015: Updated Node.js buildpack v1.17-20150429-1033

* The Node.js buildpack now comes with [IBM SDK for Node.js v0.12.1](https://developer.ibm.com/node/sdk/).
* If your application doesn’t specify a runtime in its package.json file, your app will now start by using v0.12.1, instead of v0.10.x. If you need to use the previous version, specify v0.10.x in your package.json as shown.

```
        "engines": {
            "node": "0.10.x"
        }
```
{: codeblock}

* Known issues with v0.12.1:
   * The “Suspend” feature is broken when you use the Debug Tools feature provided by Bluemix Live Sync.
   * The mqlight module that is used for the MQ Light service is not supported on v0.12.x

* Various security vulnerabilities were resolved:
  * Fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL affecting IBM SDK for Node.js. More details are available in the [security bulletin](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21701494).
  * Fixed vulnerability in RC4 Stream Cipher affecting IBM SDK for Node.js. More details are available in the [security bulletin](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21882778).
