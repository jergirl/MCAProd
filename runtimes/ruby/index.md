# Ruby
{: #ruby_runtime}
*Last Updated: 06 July 2016*
{: .last-updated}

The Ruby runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is powered by the ruby_buildpack.
The ruby_buildpack provides a complete runtime environment for Ruby apps.
{: shortdesc}

The ruby_buildpack is used if your app has a Gemfile in the root directory. It will then use Bundler to install your dependencies.

## Starter application
{: #starter_application}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides a Ruby starter application.  The Ruby starter application is a simple Ruby app that provides a template that you can use for your app. You can experiment with the starter app, and make and push changes to the  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}
environment.  See [Using the starter applications](../../cfapps/starter_app_usage.html) for help with using the starter application.

## Runtime versions
{: #runtime_versions}

You can specify the version of Ruby to be used by your app in your application's Gemfile, for example:


```
  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  ruby '2.1.7'
  gem 'sinatra', '>= 0'
  gem 'haml', '>= 0'
  gem 'json', '>=0'
```
{: codeblock}

When a version is not specified, version 2.2.4 is chosen by default.

### Available versions:
{: #available_versions}

The following Ruby versions are available in the
[Ruby buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/releases/tag/v1.6.16)
currently installed in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}:
