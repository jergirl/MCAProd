You can set up your mobile app to use the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} SDK.  After you add the SDK, you can start setting up authentication and monitoring for your app. The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} SDK is available for Android, iOS, and Cordova. A new Swift SDK has been released, making it easier to protect your back-end resources. Follow the instructions for adding the SDK, configuring your app to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} services, and write code for accessing server resources.
