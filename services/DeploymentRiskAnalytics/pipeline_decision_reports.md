To run {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} in the pipeline, start the pipeline from the initial stage as you normally would, or if you would prefer to just test {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}, run a stage that contains {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} jobs.
{:shortdesc}

After your pipeline has been configured and run, {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} starts to collect and analyze the test results from your pipeline to establish a baseline. Each time the pipeline runs, data is collected and compared against previous runs. After the analysis is complete, at each gate {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} decides to either allow the deployment to proceed or stop the pipeline if the criteria for the gate was not met.

To view the decision report for a gate, complete these steps:

   1. On the stage that contains the gate to check, click **View logs and history**.

   2. From the jobs window of the stage, click the gate's name.
