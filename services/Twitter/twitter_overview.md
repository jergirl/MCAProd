Use {{site.data.keyword.twitterfull}} to incorporate Twitter content from the Twitter [Decahose](http://support.gnip.com/apis/firehose/overview.html){: new_window} or [PowerTrack](http://support.gnip.com/apis/powertrack/overview.html){: new_window} streams into your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} applications.

The content store is refreshed and indexed in real-time, making searches dynamic and fast. The service enriches Tweets with sentiment and other insights for multiple languages, based on deep natural language processing algorithms from [IBM Social Media Analytics](http://www.ibm.com/software/products/en/social-media-analytics/){: new_window}. Real-time processing of Twitter data streams is fully supported and configurable through a rich set of query parameters and keywords. {{site.data.keyword.twittershort}} includes RESTful APIs that allow you to customize your searches and returns Tweets and enrichments in JSON format. Returned Tweets adhere to the [Gnip Activity Stream](http://support.gnip.com/sources/twitter/data_format.html){: new_window} format for Twitter data.

The {{site.data.keyword.twittershort}} service analyzes the Twitter Decahose and PowerTrack streams in real-time to provide the following enrichments for each Tweet's author:
* Gender
* Permanent location (defined by country, state, and city)

The following enrichments are also available for Tweet content:

* Sentiment (positive, negative, ambivalent, or neutral for Tweets in English, German, French, and Spanish)
* Positive/negative sentiment phrases contained in a Tweet (for Tweets in English, German, French, and Spanish)

To validate {{site.data.keyword.twittershort}} search results, the service provides a REST API method that confirms whether a particular Tweet is still accessible on Twitter.
