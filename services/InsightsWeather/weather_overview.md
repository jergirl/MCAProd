# About Insights for Weather
{: #about_weather}

*Last updated: 01 July 2016*
{: .last-updated}

Use Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix to incorporate weather data from
The Weather Company (TWC) into your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} applications.
{:shortdesc}

**This service is deprecated:** All instances of this service are deprecated. 
The revised service is available in Bluemix as Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix.  
Current apps that use the Insights for Weather APIs will continue to work without 
any modifications for 90 days after the Weather Company data service is released on July 1 2016.
To take advantage of the newly added APIs and the improved pricing model, 
it is in your best interest to migrate to one of the new plans.
{:deprecated}

You can add weather observations and forecasts to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application and display the weather data
for an area that is specified by a geolocation by using the [REST APIs](https://twcservice.{APPDomain}/rest-api-deprecated/){:new_window}.
The Weather Company is the most comprehensive provider of historical and forecast
weather data. Data for all forms of weather, including precipitation, barometric pressure,
wind, and thunderstorms, is captured.

You can use the REST APIs to retrieve the following information:

* An hourly weather forecast for the next 24 hours that starts from the current time for a specified geolocation.
* A daily weather forecast for the next 10 days that includes forecasts for the daytime and nighttime segments for a specified geolocation. This forecast includes the forecast narrative text string of up to 256 characters with appropriate units of measure for the location and in the language requested.
* The current observed weather data for a specified geolocation. This weather data includes temperature, precipitation, wind direction and speed, humidity, barometric pressure, dew point, visibility, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.
* The observed weather data for a specified geolocation and a specified time range. This data is sourced from physical observation stations. This API returns weather observations for current conditions and past observations up to and including the previous 24 hours.

You can also [download a set of icons](https://twcdocs.mybluemix.net/download/weatherinsightsicons.zip){:new_window} to use in your app.

## Pricing model
{: #pricing_models}

The pricing model is based on daily calls to the Insights for Weather APIs that
are charged to the client monthly. You can test the weather data in your applications
for any geographic area, forecast type, or time series observations with only a
restriction on number of calls. The Free, Base, and Premium plans can be purchased
without a contract. These plans allow your app to make 500, 5,000, or 50,000 API calls per day respectively.

Multiple Premium plans can also be purchased for each service instance that is
deployed during the billing period. If your app uses more than 50,000 calls per
day or over 1,000 calls per minute, you need a contract with IBM for ongoing provision of services.

When your app reaches the limit of API calls that it is allowed to make based on
the plan that you selected, the next API call that is made will not succeed
until your app is allowed to request more API calls.

For example, if you are using the Base plan, your app can make 500 API calls in a
minute even though it exceeds the limit of the plan, but the next API call won't
be allowed until 5 minutes later. Therefore, a user might notice a delay in the
refresh of weather data in your app. You must ensure that you develop your app
to handle these limits and not request bursts of API calls. Instead, you can
monitor the API call usage of your app. You can verify whether your app reaches the
limit of its plan by checking the number of items that are returned by the API call.
