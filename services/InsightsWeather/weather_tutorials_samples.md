Learn how to use the Insights for Weather service with the following examples.
{: shortdesc}

**This service is deprecated:** All instances of this service are deprecated. 
The revised service is available in Bluemix as Weather Company Data for IBM Bluemix.  
Current apps that use the Insights for Weather APIs will continue to work without 
any modifications for 90 days after the Weather Company data service is released on July 1 2016.
To take advantage of the newly added APIs and the improved pricing model, 
it is in your best interest to migrate to one of the new plans.

## Insights for Weather demo
{: #insights_weather_demo}

You can use a sample application to view weather data by using the Insights for Weather service.
The application is accessible by navigating to [http://insights-for-weather-demo.mybluemix.net/](http://insights-for-weather-demo.mybluemix.net/).
The application opens in your browser and asks you whether you want to share your current location with the app.

From the sample application, you can see the current observed conditions for the weather in your location.

![Image of main screen with current observations for Ottawa, ON.](images/twctestapp_main_screen.jpg "Image of main screen with current observations for Ottawa, ON.")

You can also see the hourly forecast for the next 24 hours and the daily forecast for the next 10 days.
If you hover over each of these areas in the sample, you can see the results of the API call in JSON format,
which includes the metadata that was used to retrieve the data.

In the demo application, click **Deploy to Bluemix** to create a cloned version of the application
or [clone the app directly from GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/insights-for-weather-demo).

## Getting a standard 10-day forecast
{: #getting_ten_day_forecast}

You can issue a `GET` operation in your application to retrieve the 10-day forecast data.
For example, you can use the following `GET` request to retrieve the 10-day forecast for Ottawa, ON, Canada:

```
GET https://<username>:<password>@twcservice.mybluemix.net:443/api/weather/v2/forecast/daily/10day?units=m&geocode=45.42%2C75.69&language=en-US
}
```

The `username` and `password` are unique to your application and service instance.
You can find this information in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables.

The service returns responses in JSON format. If the response is successful, a status code of 200 is returned.
If the response is unsuccessful, an error code is returned.

The body of the response includes metadata and an array of daily forecasts for each of the next 10 days.
For example, the metadata might contain the following data:

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "language": "en-US",
    "transaction_id": "1443712484194:-1546029161",
    "version": "1",

    "expire_time_gmt": 1443714284,
    "status_code": 200
  },
  "forecasts": [
  ]
}
```

Each daily forecast contains general information that applies to the 24-hour period for the specified day of the week (`dow`).
For example, the daily forecast might contain the following data:

```
    {
      "class": "fod_long_range_daily",

Each daily forecast contains a night part and a day part for the specified day of the week.
For example, both of these parts might contain the following forecast data:

```
      "night": {
        "fcst_valid": 1444568400,

## Getting current conditions
{: #current_conditions}

You can issue a `GET` operation in your application to retrieve the current weather conditions.
For example, you can use the following `GET` request to retrieve the current conditions for Ottawa, ON, Canada:

```
GET https://<username>:<password>@twcservice.mybluemix.net:443/api/weather/v2/observations/current?units=m&geocode=45.42%2C75.69&language=en-US
