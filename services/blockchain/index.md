# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} (Beta)
{: #gettingstartedtemplate}
*Last updated: 2 June 2016*
{: .last-updated}

With the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} service on Bluemix, you can quickly spin up a blockchain network and circumvent the complexities involved with manually creating a development environment.  Rather than creating and managing a network, developers can spend their time generating applications and working with chaincode.  The service is a peer-to-peer permissioned network built on top of the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger [fabric code](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric).

You can use a blockchain network to exchange financial records through a shared ledger. For more information about shared ledgers and business networks, see the [About {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}}](ibmblockchain_overview.html) topic.

To get started, follow these steps to create and deploy an unbound service instance of a {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} network.  Once complete, you will have your own development environment with validating nodes and a security service. From there, you can deploy chaincode, see results, and build your applications:

1. From the landing page for the [{{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} DevOps Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/), complete the following fields in the **Add Service** window:
  - Choose **dev** from the **Space** drop-down window.
  - Leave the **App** field as **Leave unbound**.
  - Change the **Service name** to **myblockchain123**, or some value unique to you.
  - Leave the **Credential name** field as its default value.
  - Leave the **Selected Plan** as its default value.
  - Click **CREATE**.
2.  You are now on the **Service Dashboard** screen for your new service.  From here you can **Manage** your instance of the network:
  - Click **LAUNCH** to see the blockchain monitor for your {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} network.
3.  The blockchain monitor displays network details, live logs, current ledger state, APIs, and chaincode templates.  Use the dashboard for any of the following functions:
  - Access Discovery and API routes for the peers on your network.
  - View any currently-running chaincode containers.
  - View real-time logs and troubleshoot chaincode that fails to execute.
  - View the world state for your ledger.
  - Access the Swagger UI and interact with your network via the REST API.
  - Deploy one of three available chaincode examples.
