# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.vpn_short}}
{: #vpn}  
*Last updated: 08 June 2016*
{: .last-updated}

The {{site.data.keyword.vpn_full}} service for Bluemix&reg; is available to securely access IBM Containers (Docker containers) inside the IBM Bluemix cloud environment. You can use the IBM Bluemix cloud environment as an extension of your corporate data center. You can also connect with the SoftLayer servers using the IBM VPN service.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, ensure that you have a Docker container ready to use by adding one with IBM Containers. See [IBM Containers](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html) for details about how to create and manage IBM Containers.  

To get started, select the **Virtual Private Network** service instance tile on the Bluemix dashboard. Complete the following steps:

1. Configure the {{site.data.keyword.vpn_short}} gateway by selecting **Create Gateway**. A default gateway is created. If required, edit the gateway configuration as shown in the following steps.  
{: #gateway}  

  1. Select **EDIT**.  
  2. Specify the gateway name.  
  3. Select the container and container group with which you want to use the VPN service.  
	**Note:** The container and container group private subnets are preselected so that you can access them over the VPN connection.
  4. Select **SAVE**.  

 You can use the default IKE and IPsec policies, or configure custom policies. If you want to use the default policies, skip to step 4.

2. Configure the IKE policy by selecting the **IKE & IPsec Policies** tab.
  1. Select **ADD NEW**.  
  2. Specify the following details:
	* **Name**: Name of the IKE policy
	* **Authorization Algorithm**: sha1 or sha256  
	* **Encryption Algorithm**: Select from drop-down. Values: aes-128 (default), aes-192, aes-256, 3des
	* **Key Lifetime**: Lifetime value (in seconds) of the IKE security association. Range: 60-86400. Default Value: 86400
	* **PFS**: Diffie-Hellman (DH) group identifier. Values: Group2, Group5, Group14. Default value: Group2
	* **Negotiation Mode**: Main; cannot be changed
	* **Version**: IKEV1; cannot be changed
  3. Select **SAVE**.

3. Configure the IPsec policy:
  1. Select **ADD NEW**.  
  2. Specify the following details:
  	* **Name**: Name of the IPsec policy  
  	* **Authorization Algorithm**: sha1 or sha256  
  	* **Encryption Algorithm**: Select from drop-down. Values: aes-128 (default), aes-192, aes-256, 3des
  	* **Key Lifetime**: Lifetime value (in seconds) of the security association. Range: 60-86400. Default Value: 3600
  	* **PFS**: Diffie-Hellman (DH) group identifier. Values: Group2, Group5, Group14. Default value: Group2
  	* **Transform Protocol**: ESP; cannot be changed
  	* **Encapsulation Mode**: Tunnel; cannot be changed
  3. Select **SAVE**.  

4. Provide the details to establish a connection between your data center or SoftLayer server VPN gateway, and the IBM VPN gateway.  
{: #site}  

  1. Select **Create Connection** in the **Site Connections** section.
  2. Specify the following site connection details:  
  	* **Name**: Name of the connection  
  	* **Description**: Description of the connection (optional)  
  	* **Preshared Key String**: Preshared (secret) key to be used for authentication. Select **SHOW** to view the key in plain text.
  	* **Admin State**: Status of the VPN connection. Select from drop-down: UP or DOWN. Default value: UP  
  	**Note:** You must do the initial configuration with the admin state as ***UP*** and save it. Later, you can change the admin state to ***DOWN***, if required.  
  	* **Customer Gateway IP**: Remote endpoint IP address of the VPN tunnel  
  	* **Customer Subnet**: Remote subnet address in CIDR format. Select the plus sign to add another subnet.
  3. (Optional) Configure the following **Advanced Settings** parameters:  
  	* **IKE Policy**: Select the IKE policy.  
  	* **Keep Alive Interval**: Keepalive interval in seconds. Send keepalive messages at the configured interval to check liveliness of the peer. Default value: 15. Range: 5-86399
  	* **Action on dead peer**: Action to be taken when the peer is detected as dead.  
    	Values: 
  		* hold (default value): the security association (SA) is put on hold.  
  		**Note:** To resume the SA negotiation after recovery of the dead peer, set the connection admin state to **DOWN**, save it, and then reset it to **UP**.
  		* clear: the SA is deleted immediately
  		* disabled: the SA is disabled until the timeout value expires
  		* restart: the SA is put on hold until the timeout value expires, after which the SA is renegotiated
  		* restart-by-peer: the SA is put on hold and the connection information is retained; a new connection is established after the peer initiates a connection request  
  	* **IPsec Policy**: Select the IPsec policy.
  	* **Keep Alive Timeout**: Timeout value in seconds after which the session is terminated. Default value: 120. Range: 6-86400. The keep alive timeout value must be higher than the keep alive interval value.
  4. Select **SAVE**.

  **Note:** The connection can take up to a minute to activate. During this time, the GUI does auto refresh to reflect the most recent status. If the connection is not active even after a minute, manually refresh the screen to see the status. If the status is still inactive, verify the connection information.

**Important:** If you are using a web application, you must bind the web application to the Docker container you are using. This binding is required for the traffic to pass through the IPsec VPN tunnel.

**Important:** The IBM VPN service currently operates in initiator mode. To initiate the VPN connection, a data packet must flow out from the IBM VPN gateway to your on-premises data center or SoftLayer server. Once the VPN connection is established, traffic can flow in either direction between endpoints of the VPN connection.
